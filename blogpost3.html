         <p class="font1">Microsoft recently announced that Copilot, the company’s implementation of generative AI, will be coming soon to Windows and Office 365. While Microsoft is already using generative AI in its Bing search engine, its introduction to Microsoft’s core productivity tools promises to redefine how we interact with technology at work and home. Although this is undoubtedly a game-changing move, it feels somewhat like a missed opportunity. With the capabilities of generative AI, particularly in conversation, what Microsoft is doing could have been much more. It could have blown past existing voice assistants like Apple’s Siri, Google Assistant, and Amazon Alexa to be truly amazing. That’s just a bit sad. Let’s explore generative AI on the desktop this week, and we’ll close with my Product of the Week, a new laptop from Microsoft’s Surface unit that is arguably one of the best ever made for creators.</p>
         <p class="font1">Microsoft put competitors like Google and Amazon on notice when it brought ChatGPT generative AI to Bing. While there have been some growing pains, if you know what you are doing (more on that later), you can get the information you want more quickly with Bing now. But when Copilot is applied to Microsoft’s productivity, operating system, and collaboration products, it promises so much more. Imagine being able to describe a presentation and then having your computer create it as if it were your personal assistant. Imagine being able to create an outline of a book, article, or paper and have your computer do the rest, including taking care of the spelling and grammar issues. Imagine being able to ask Excel a question about the financial report you are looking at and have the application provide you with an almost immediate and complete answer. That’s the future that Microsoft’s generative AI feature, Copilot, promises. You provide the direction. It will create the finished product. All of this begins to roll out at the end of this month — it has been available to beta testers since August, with the enterprise release on Nov. 1 for a cost of around $30 per month per user.</p>
         <p class="font1">As generative gets its voice, we will shortly be able to talk to this tool as if it were another person. I’ve messed with earlier versions, and my experience was interesting and compelling. But what is truly sad is that Microsoft created the perfect inroad to this tool with Cortana, which came from Microsoft’s Halo game, and anticipated this capability decades before its availability. There was even an attempt to create a fully holographic Cortana, which evolved to another version that worked in AR to create an even more compelling experience. They were approaching the Cortana experience from the game. Over a year ago, Nvidia showcased technology coming to the next generation of cars that would close that last gap and make Cortana real.</p>
         <p class="font1">Copilot is Microsoft’s third attempt to get digital assistants right. The first foray was Microsoft Bob in 1995, which was way ahead of its time and mis-marketed as a replacement for the graphical user interface (GUI). To clarify, while a voice interface might eventually replace the GUI, the technology to achieve this was not available in the 1990s. Next came Cortana. It was as good or better than Siri or Google Assistant initially, but we wanted the function in a standalone device or smartphone, not in a PC, and Microsoft just didn’t seem motivated to make that happen. So, I’m sad that we are getting Copilot and not Cortana because the latter would have been a far more fun and forward-looking digital assistant.</p>
